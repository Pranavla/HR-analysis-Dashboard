# Power BI Dashboard for HR Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into key HR metrics for a company with 1,470 employees. Initially focusing on a subset of 74 employees, this dashboard marks the beginning of a data-driven approach to enhancing recruitment processes, improving employee retention, and optimizing attendance tracking.

## Future Plans

This project is the first step in a broader initiative to apply HR analytics across the entire organization. By starting with a focused group of 74 employees, the company aims to refine its data analysis techniques and expand them to include all employees in the near future.
